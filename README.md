# TSDZ2-Smart-EBike-compatible-with-original-VLCD6-display
This project is based on the TSDZ2-Smart-EBike repository, but is also compatible with the original VLCD6 display (VLCD5 and HX18 not tested).
- The walk assist function has been implemented and it works with 5 level of assistance.
- Implemented Java user interface (TDSZ2 Configurator), useful to configure many parameters of program memory and data memory (eeprom) of   the controller.
- The TDSZ2 Configurator run with JRE runtime.... so it must be installed!
- Using TDSZ2 Configurator you can enable the use of both type of display KT-LCD3 and VLCD6 (compatible also VLCD5 and XH18).
- The light-gray fields of the TSDZ2 Configurator are reserved for "expert users".
- Using TDSZ2 Configurator you can save configuration files (.ini) and move them from experimental settings folder to proven settings.
- by clicking the "help" button, a pdf document will open. It contains information regarding the user interface parameters and addresses     related to eeprom memory.
